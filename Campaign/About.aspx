    <h3>Quick info about Campaign Manager</h3>
    <p>The basic idea behind Campaign Manager is that there should be a place that a DM could store all of the information needed for their campaigns. Without using a 3-ring binder or other paper method. 
        Being able to quickly find what you need, from maps and npc descriptions, to notes about campaign status and events that they'd like to build in. 
        Making the DM process that much more streamlined and taking a little stress out of the process is our goal.</p>
